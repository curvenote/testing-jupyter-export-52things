  :name: 937f52db
```

Bert Bril is a geophysicist by training, but a software developer by heart. He uses most languages with a capital ‘C’ in it, but he isn’t afraid of many other languages. He is co-founder of dGB Earth Sciences, where he was one of the initiators of OpendTect. In the OpendTect team he is mainly involved in getting basic architecture and design in shape, but still does a lot of coding each day. He likes to work truly agile, and believes that methodologies like scrum are usually not helping to get that right. Against his will he is also being deployed as the specialist in the SEG-Y format - this mainly because no one else in the OpendTect team wants to get near the subject. As a survivor of lots of surgery on his heart valves he doesn’t care about a lot of things that most people do. One of his long-term goals is to get better at staying away from rants and flames.

He moved to Houston with Conoco's Advance Exploration group, building a worldwide database of all its oil and gas data using a distributed database. After a stint in Lafayette as data management supervisor, he left Conoco to join Applied Geophysical Software, where he wrote geophysical software for multiple suppression, model-building, tomography, and depth migration. Bill rejoined Conoco in 1998 and assisted with the rewrite of Conoco’s seismic processing system. From the ConocoPhillips merger in 2002 until March 2009 he supervised a geophysical software and HPC group. At ConocoPhillips, Bill was instrumental in obtaining open source licensing for CPS (the processing system) <http://sourceforge.net/projects/cpseis> and GeoCraft, a framework for general purpose geophysical software. Bill is co-founder, former board member, and past President of the Society of HPC Professionals. After Conoco, Bill worked at Fusion Technology, Global Geophysical, and ION/GXT.

[John](https://curvenote.com/@grajohnt) is a research geoscientist that has been working in the oil industry since he was 19 years old. He holds a B.Sc. *summa cum laude* and a Ph.D. in the Geosciences from the University of Texas at Dallas. He pioneered the use of 3D outcrop capture techniques before going on to work in various roles in production and exploration, ultimately ending up as an exploration manager before realizing that the further you go up the chain, the less fun you can have by working with real problems. He has too many hobbies to rationally keep up with, including 3D printing, antenna design, and developing absurd gadgetry, but that doesn't stop him from finding new ones on a regular basis.

Florian is interested in all aspects of complexity, information and uncertainty about the subsurface. He has a background in Geology and Geophysics, with a high level of curiosity in programming and statistics, and he has experience in both geological interpolations and geostatistics, as well as HPC process simulations of fluid flow and heat transport. Currently, he has a position as Junior-Professor in “Numerical Reservoir Engineering” at RWTH Aachen University, Germany.
